•	How do I approach designing software?

In order to approach software design correctly, it is best to see what the client's needs are. Once you separate the wants from the needs, you then need to get any ambiguity answered to achieve the requirement correctly. 

•	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Before this class, I had not had any experience with coding visual graphics. I also have not had any experience with OpenGL. Now that I have done reading and research for this class, I can say with confidence that I can add shapes and moving parts to my application. I can also create a 3D scene that you can move around with different inputs. 

•	What design process did you follow for your project work?

The design process for this project was completely based on the requirements given from the specifications document (rubric). Since the requirements were transparent, it was a great bases to reference and build the application design off of. The requirements helped ensure that I maintained focus of what the client wanted. 

•	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

These tactics can be applied in future work by way of researching on how to get the correct shape function, as well as being able to texture shapes so they look realistic according to the picture that was given. 

•	How do I approach developing programs?

Developing different programs can be pretty tricky depending on what the needs of the client are. When developing programs, the best approach is to do what is best for you (ethics, moral, etc.) as well as do the best for your client. Also, when developing, it is best to know what your clients needs are in order to strategize around them. As previously stated, the requirements change in an Agile project. Therefore, abiding by the requirements given by the client will ensure that they remain happy.

•	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Everything I did in this project was new to me. Since I am still new to visual graphic design, it was a challenge for me to implement everything I have learned throughout this course. Nevertheless, less I used multiple strategies from drawing triangles to drawing circles. I also implemented various forms of input such as keyboard and mouse input to change the camera angles and positions

•	How did iteration factor into your development?

Since the majority of the things we do in OpenGL are done by the render loop, it was important that I factored in iterations into my development. Since the render/game loop is an infinite loop of what is happening in the window, I had to incorporate things inside the loop that would change with every iteration. 

•	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?

The approach between the milestones allowed me to not get overwhelmed when it came time for the final project. With the milestones being every week, there were a lot of things that needed to be changed/implemented every week in order to better prepare.  I have been able to see the bigger picture more and more as the weeks went on. 

•	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science is going to help me reach my goal of making money and being able to care for my family because the industry is always growing and with technological advancements comes even more growth in the field. With more growth comes more jobs. Therefore, with a growing job market there will always be opportunities for growth as a professional as well as growth as a person overall. 

•	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

While enrolled in this class I have found even more trusty sights when researching how to go about doing something. I have learned that the class resource is a great way to draw triangles, and Stack-Overflow is a great resource when you are stuck with an issue or an exception that you cannot figure out. With the new resources it was fun learning how to make my own functions for things such as receiving input from different devices. 

•	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

This course has helped me with my professionalism by giving me the confidence I needed to ask for help when needed, it also helped me focus on the chain of command when I had an issue. It also helped me by simulating if I had an issue in the workplace, then I would reach out to my peers for advice if I am hard stuck on an exception that I am receiving.
